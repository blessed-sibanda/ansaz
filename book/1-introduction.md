# Introduction

Welcome to _Concise Rails 6_, a fast paced and enhanced tutorial
designed to explain the core concepts of Rails in a very practical
way.

## What is Ruby on Rails

Ruby on Rails is popular web framework that is written in the Ruby
programming language that allows developers to quickly build
powerful and robust web applications. It’s commonly referred to
as Rails and often abbreviated as RoR.

Everything in Rails is designed to make developers’ lives easier by
making assumptions about what they need to get started when they
create a new web application. It allows developers to write less code
while at the same time accomplish more.

Ruby on Rails (RoR) was created in 2003 by David Heinemeier Hansson (aka DHH) when he was working on a project management tool
(now known as _Basecamp_). However, it wasn’t until 2004 that he
extracted the source and released it as an open-source project.

In 2005, version 1 of Ruby on Rails was officially released. Fast
forward about 16 years, Rails is now on version 6.1 (at the time of
this writing) and has been tested and proven by huge names such as Hulu, Zendesk, Soundcloud, Shopify, Groupon, Airbnb and Github -
just to name a few.

To be proficient with Rails you need a good understanding of Ruby since RoR itself is based on the Ruby programming language. Therefore, the following section is dedicated to the fundamental concepts of Ruby that are essential to Rails development.

## Assumptions
